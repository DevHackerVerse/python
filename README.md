calculator using Python

 I am Priyanshu Raj. I made this calculator using Python. 

 It perform all basic operation like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, under root, power, etc.
 I made it using while loop. So, it calculate values as many times as we want.

test.py files are the files in which I perform some codes to check that.
